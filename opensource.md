- [Lacertosus' Open Source Tweaks](https://github.com/LacertosusRepo/Open-Source-Tweaks) - These are by FAR the best open source tweaks to reference from
  - Most of them are annotated, and there are quite a few that are designed for iOS13
  - Examples for Cephei which is a powerful PreferenceBundle framework that even Apple uses

- [KodeyThomas's SpotifyBlue](https://github.com/KodeyThomas/SpotifyBlue) - This is one of my own Open Source tweaks

  - Uses Cephei for settings (Not as Well Annotated)
