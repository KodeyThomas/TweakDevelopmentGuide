# Time to Compile

So in a terminal navigate to our tweak directory and type:

```bash
make package install
```

If you have followed all the instructions you should get an output like this
```bash
❯ make package install

And its done our first tweak is completed, if you try pressing the volume buttons on your phone you will notice they now have lovely haptic feedback

If we want to export our tweak to a repo it is saved as a `debian` file known as a `.deb`

The `.deb` is saved under `.../TweakName/packages/`

Its named under the default naming convention of the `bundleID` then the build number for example the tweak we have just compiled for me is saved as:

```UTF-8
com.kodeycodesstuff.exampletweak_0.0.1-1+debug_iphoneos-arm.deb
```

Now you have made your first tweak. Congratulations

> Be sure to change THEOS_DEVICE_IP under the makefile otherwise it wont compile
