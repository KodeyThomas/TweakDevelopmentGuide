# Publishing Your Tweak

So, we have completed our tweak. Awesome!

The next question is how are we going to distribute our tweak well as you know we host them on repositories

I'm not going to go into detail about what a repository (repo) is as i'm assuming you know, i mean you have come this far.

> If you want to get downloads on your tweak make sure it lives up to Human Interface Guidelines, info can be found in that section

Information on Human Interface Guidelines can be found in the `Good Tweak Design 101` section

# Choosing Where To Host

We now need to choose where to host our tweak, we have a few options

Either host it ourselves, or host it on a popular repo. Each has there Pros and Cons


# Hosting It Ourselves

- Doesn't have to be approved
- Can be updated within minutes


- Hard to set up paid tweaks (It's possible but a lot of work)
- Takes time to set up
- Requires hosting
- Everybody has to add your repo, puts people off and you will get less publicity and ultimately less downloads  


If we want to host it ourselves our best option is using [Silica](https://silica.shuga.co) it's a relatively easy way to create our own repo

Full Documentation can be found for how to create a repo using Silica can be found [HERE](https://silica.shuga.co)

# Hosting It On A Popular Repo

Hosting on a popular repo is our best option and its the option a wide number of tweak developers use

- Easily make money off our tweaks (The repos do take a cut and the amount depends on the repo)
- Easy to set up, each repo has a different system but it is incredibly easy

- Needs to be approved for publishing (Each repo has different guidelines)

The main repos to host our tweaks on are

- [Dynastic](https://dynastic.co)
- [Packix](https://repo.packix.com)
- [Twickd](https://twickd.com)

# Hosting On Dynastic

Hosting your tweak on Dynastic is a simple process

First either email Dynastic at `support@dynastic.co` or DM them on twitter at `@DynasticSupport`

Guidelines for hosting our tweak on Dynastic can be found [HERE](https://support.dynastic.co/repo/guidelines)

Here are the main ones:

- No Copyrighted Content
- No Malware
- Must be your tweak, not somebody elses (Blatant copies of tweaks will NOT be accepted)
- Your Tweak must have `Required Functionality` in other words, it must do what it says it does (This does not include small bugs)
- Screenshots of your tweak - Try and make these eye catching


# Hosting On Packix

Hosting your tweak on Packix is also a simple process

Contact them on discord on the official Packix server an invite can be found [HERE](https://discord.com/invite/tC8sscW)

# Hosting On Twickd

Hosting on Twickd is straightforward and easy to set up

Create a Twickd account unless you already have one

We then need to go to there Developer portal found [HERE](https://developer.twickd.com/panel)

Apply for there `Developer Program` - All this requires is a validated email + a linked device

Navigate to packages then click `Add Package`

Then fill out the form

# Tips to getting past the review stage

- Have eye popping screenshots, remember we are trying too sell a product
- Make sure the tweak actually works, try and fix any bugs before release
- Have a good description, we need to explain to people what our tweak does

If you are selling a paid tweak, don't be offended if some people ask for a refund
Sometimes the tweak isn't compatible in there setup other times it just doesn't work for them.

You want to maintain a good relationship between You (The Developer) and the end consumer.
People build loyalties to different developers, make sure your tweaks are high-quality and people will keep coming back

Please also read the [`Tweak Design 101`](design.md) page as this contains good information to making a high-quality tweak that is usable
