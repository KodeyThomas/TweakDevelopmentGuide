# Tweak Development Guide

This Is A Basic Guide To Tweak Development in 2020.

# Prerequisites

  - [Theos](https://github.com/theos/theos) - This is what we will use to compile our tweak
  - [iOS 13 SDK's](https://github.com/xybp888/iOS-SDKs) - These are patched iOS 13 frameworks that contain patched PrivateFrameworks that allow us to interact with the OS's code
  - Basic Programming knowledge, ideally in obj-c as we will code our tweak in that language
  - An IDE of your choice; (either Atom or Visual Studio Code are recommended)


If You Want To Learn OBJ-C (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Here Are A Few Links:
  - [Learn Objective-C in 24 Days](https://www.binpress.com/learn-objective-c-24-days/) 
  - [Objective-C Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/objective_c/index.htm)
  - [Learn C++](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus) - Although It Isn't OBJ-C, quite a few of the principles transfer over
  
 
# Support
> Tweak Design is not easy,
> it is increadibly fustrating sometimes
> however it is very rewarding.


Although the Tweak Development Community is very welcoming and helpful
Please do try and try solve problems on your own before asking anyone

Just like in any other programming language, people have probably had your problem before

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - This is increadibly helpful for finding out solutions in programming in general.
[Google](https://google.com) - As stupid as this sounds, just a quick google can fix most issues
[Open Source Tweaks](https://github.com/LacertosusRepo/Open-Source-Tweaks) - These are a bunch of Open Source Tweaks to use as a reference if you are unsure on certain things


Enjoy this guide, and happy developing
