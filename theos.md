# Theos

Theos is the tool we will be using to create our tweaks, it can be said there are others out there such as [DragonBuild](https://github.com/DragonBuild/DragonBuild) but is a bit more complex so it isn't the best for beginners.

# About Theos

This is a cross-platform tool, we are going to use it for its simple and easy to learn syntax. It's incredibly easy to use and install.
It is also widely accepted by many as the 'go to' complier and has the most support and documentation

It is available on;

- [iOS](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-iOS) on iOS 5 and up.
- [macOS](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-macOS) on Mavericks (10.9) and up.
- [Linux/WSL](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-Linux) on Linux kernel 3.16 or Windows 10 build 14393, and up.
- [Cygwin](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation-Cygwin) on Windows 7 and up.

# Installation

  - [Theos Installation](https://github.com/theos/theos/wiki/Installation) - I won't cover how to install Theos as there is a tutorial on the official Theos Wiki
  - [iOS 13's SDK's](https://github.com/xybp888/iOS-SDKs) - Follow the installation for these after you install Theos

If you get stuck there is a good guide on YouTube by Zane Helton - [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNXd4KLLjhk)


# Syntax

Theos uses Objective-C for coding our tweaks, however it also uses a preprocessor called [Logos](https://github.com/theos/logos) it simplifies how we hook in Objective-C and makes it a lot easier to use in general

> Logos aims to provide an interface for Cydia Substrate by default, but can be configured to directly use the Objective-C runtime.

Basically it just makes our lives a lot simpler if we use it. So we have to learn it's syntax

# Next Steps

So now Theos is installed and configured, we can move on to learn the syntax of Logos as it is incredibly important for Tweak Development
